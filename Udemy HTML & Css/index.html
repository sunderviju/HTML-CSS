				<p>This Handbook is aimed for all stakeholders of Indian Football
					who have access to all game requirements for children within
					this age group, be it clubs, academies, schools, non-government
					organizations, parents, coaches, football fans. Everyone!
					Anyone can organize the AIFF Golden Baby Leagues,
					anywhere in the country. The Leagues aim to provide access
					to football in the children's locality irrespective of gender,
					religion, economic background or ethnic origin.</p>
				<p>As a League Operator, we hope you find this document easy to
					understand and useful for implementing in reality. At the heart
					of creating this document is the experience of the player!</p>

				<p>AIFF introduces the second edition of the AIFF Golden Baby
					Leagues for the season 2019-2020. We believe ages 6-12
					years form the Golden age of learning for young boys and
					girls. Learning through games while having fun, making
					friendships and developing team spirit are key ingredients in
					developing a football player for life.

				<p>We want to know how this Handbook can be made even better
					next year. We also want to hear stories about players, teams,
					volunteers, coaches, parents, league operators and everyone
					who is involved in this project with you. We appreciate your
					queries, feedback, and stories at babyleagues@the-aiff.com.
				</p>

				<p>
					We wish you all the best for the new season!
